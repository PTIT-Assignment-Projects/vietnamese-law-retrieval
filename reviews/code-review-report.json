    "summary": "<think>\nAlright, let's go through this. The user wants a summary of the code review in one sentence. The code changes include new files for an inverted index and a text processor. The preprocessing code was moved to a separate class, which is a good refactoring. The main issue found was a syntax error in the function definition.\n\nFirst, I need to highlight the key changes: moving logic to a class, creating new files, and fixing the syntax error. Also, the code was cleaned up, so maybe an award for refactoring. Looking at the awards available, \"Refactoring Archmage\" fits because they transformed the preprocessing code into a class structure. \n\nThe original code had 47 lines, and the new class-based approach is more organized. The user also mentioned not to include the issues themselves but the fact that an issue was detected. So I should mention the syntax error fix as well. \n\nPutting it all together: the summary should mention the refactoring, the award, and the syntax fix. Make sure to follow the formatting rules and only mention the award if it's given. Since the code was moved to a class, the structure is better, so the award is appropriate. Check the examples to see how the award is formatted with the <!-- award --> comment. Got it.\n</think>\n\n<!-- award -->\n\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f REFACTORING ARCHMAGE \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\"You transformed messy preprocessing logic into a clean `TextProcessor` class with single-responsibility focus. Like Albus Dumbledore organizing the Hogwarts archives, this refactoring turns procedural chaos into object-oriented harmony while fixing a critical syntax error in the original code.\"",
